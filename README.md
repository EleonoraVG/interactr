# interactr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tomvaneyck/interactr.svg?token=FPNLswsrEcU8j2kxQqnx&branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/tomvaneyck/interactr)
An interaction diagram drawing tool.

## Context
In the third year of our bachelor degree we were tasked to build an interactive user interface. We could not use any existing gui-libraries. Instead we received a minimal library that allowed us to paint what we wanted on the screen.

## Design choices
We opted for the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for our interface. We also used the ReactiveX library for C#, *Rx<nolink>.NET*, to create an event-driven system.
